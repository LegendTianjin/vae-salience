Roberts left one note for his wife , one for each of his three children and a note and checklist in his truck , Miller said .
Roberts , a 32-year-old truck driver , married with children , entered the Georgetown Amish School and took about 30 children , as well as teachers and assistants , hostage , Miller said .
State police have said Roberts might have been planning to sexually assault the Amish girls but there was no evidence that he actually did .
Miller said police could not confirm Roberts IV 's claim about molesting young relatives when Roberts would have been a just a child or adolescent himself , and he said Roberts ' family members knew nothing of molestation in his past .
